# PyBer Analysis 

## Purpose 
We have been tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that depicts the total weekly fares for each city type. With this curated data we will compare and contrast the different city types and how these observations can be used to inform decisions at PyBer.


## Results
### Urban City
Urban Cities compose a majority of the fares produced, number of drivers, and number of rides. Out of the total $63,538.64 made from fares between the three types of cities, urban cities compose around 62.72% of this, translating into $39.854.38 of fares. Of the 2,973 total drivers from all the types of cities, urban cities compose around 80.89% of the drivers, translating into 2,405 drivers.  Of the 2,375 total rides between all the cities, 68.42% of those rides are in urban cities, translating into 1,625 total rides. 

Another thing is that while urban cities have the most fares, drivers, and rides, they have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per Driver. The average fare per ride for urban cities is $24.53. Suburban cities have an average fare per ride that is $6.44 more ($30.97 avg fare) and rural cities have an average fare per ride that is $10.09 more ($34.62 avg fare). Urban cities have an average fare per driver at $16.57. Suburban cities have an average fare per driver that is $22.93 costlier ($39.50 avg fare) and rural cities have an average fare per driver that is $38.92 costlier ($55.49 avg fare).

### Suburban City
Suburban Cities are the homes of the middle values of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

### Rural City
Rural Cities are the homes of the lowest values of total rides, total drivers, and total fares.There are only 125 total rides with only 78 drivers. The fares that are collected only amount to $4,327.93 - only 6.81% of fares collected between all three types of cities. Despite having the lowest total rides and lowest fares collected, rural cities are the homes for the costliest average fare per ride and average fare per driver at $34.62 and $55.49, respectively.

## Summary - provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types  

- Rural Cities bring in significantly less fares compared to their suburban and urban counterparts. Looking into these deficiencies would be wise. The combination of very few total rides and drivers with high average fares per ride and driver makes it an unappealing venture for both the consumer and the company. 

- Rural Cities and their high average fare per ride and average fare per driver may contribute to the lack of riders and drivers,  and consequently, fares collected. Any potential riders may be discouraged by the cost of the ride, driving away business and not incentivizing drivers to drive in these areas as they would not be earning as much. Further understanding the nature of this conundrum may be worth looking into

- Urban Cities seem to be doing well so a pivot in focus, specifically directed towards rural cities, may be beneficial. More resources could be drawn towards rural cities. This may lead to some shortcoming in other types of cities so we may need to be careful. Additionally, these shortcomings may be worth it if the company can bring rural cities up to speed with the other two types of cities.
